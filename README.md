## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer. Currently started to learn Flutter. While exploring the flutter and dart concepts, implemented some of the features and widgets in this Application. After the static application of Profile Card Application
[@MyCard User Profile App](https://github.com/vijai-ks/MyCard-User-Profile-Application),
moved to interactive application to interact with user. Then created a interactive application of [@Dice Application](https://github.com/vijai-ks/Dicee). Then created [@Magic Balls](https://github.com/vijai-ks/Magic_Balls) application, after this created [@Xylophone - Music App](https://github.com/vijai-ks/Xylophone_App). Then exploring on more flutter things, created this real time application with the implementation of OOPS concepts in this application.
